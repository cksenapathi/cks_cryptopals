will contain notes on my attempts

set1 prob1
================
- can't just cast chars into ints, bc they will use ascii values
- convert hex chars to binary repr of hex values, then binary to b64

set1 prob2
=============
- no additional malloc since output string was just printed
- str manipulation is much easier with some tricks e.g., strchr()
